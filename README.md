A weather fashion app that shows you the weather and recommends stylish clothes for you to wear!

# Project Description

Want to know the weather and what to wear according to zip code?

Would you like fashion tips for that specific vacation location.

WeatherX has the solution.

WeatherX is using Realtime weather data for your everyday fashion needs.

WeatherX checks the weather for any zip code and then recommends what to wear based on the weather conditions.

WeatherX can potentially be a new way to advertise or used for eCommerce

Nowadays, people barely have time to go out and shop for clothes.

WeatherX is currently at its concept stage with great potential and is presently accepting angel investors.

# Code Snippet

//-----Variable temp holds response Data from API-----//

let temp = response.data.main.temp
let condition = response.data.weather[0].main

let showTemp = document.createElement("h2")
let textTemp = document.createTextNode(temp + " Â° F" + " " + condition);
weather.append(showTemp)
showTemp.append(textTemp)
setTimeout("showIt()", 3000);
}

# Change Log

I originally wanted to have the weather checked instantly using
another Geo Location API, but then I realized if someone wants to
check for a different location that would not be possible, so I changed the data to pull using a zip
code.
