# WeatherX

A weather fashion app that shows you the weather and recommends stylish clothes for you to wear!

# Project Description

Do you want to check the weather and pick out your clothes at the same time without having to
overthink what to wear that day?

Maybe you are going on vacation and would like tips on what to wear?

WeatherX has the solution.

Realtime weather data is used for your everyday fashion needs.

WeatherX checks the weather for any zip code and then recommends what to wear based on the weather conditions.

WeatherX can potentially be a new way to advertise or used for eCommerce

WeatherX is currently at its concept stage of an app with great potential

and is presently accepting angel investors.

# Code Snippet

# Change Log

I originally wanted to have the weather checked instantly, but then I realized if someone wants to
check for a different location, that would not be possible, so I changed the data to pull using a zip
code.
